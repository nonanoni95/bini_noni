<h2>Warfarin</h2>
<hr>
<strong><u><a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00682" target = "_blank" title="warfarin specification">Warfarin</a></u> is an anticoagulant drug</strong> normally used to prevent blood clot formation as well as migration.
  Although originally marketed as a pesticide (d-Con, Rodex, among others), Warfarin has since become the most frequently prescribed oral
  anticoagulant in North America. <p>Warfarin has several properties that should be noted when used medicinally,
  including its ability to cross the placental barrier during pregnancy which can result in fetal bleeding,
  spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Additional adverse effects such as necrosis,
  purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use.

  <p>Warfarin does not actually affect blood viscosity, rather, it inhibits vitamin-k dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of various
  clotting factors in addition to several regulatory factors.</p>
